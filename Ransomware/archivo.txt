I feel like I'm walking a tightrope without a circus net
Popping Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect, but I work a sweat for this worthless check
'Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
It's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watching ballers while they flossing in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half-pinters
While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
